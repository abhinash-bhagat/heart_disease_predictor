# heart_disease_predictor
A ML Model that predicts if a person has heart problem or not.
This project looks into using various Pythin-based machine learning and data science libraries in an attempt ML model capable of wheather or not someone has heart diseases based on their medical attributes

**Steps to approach**
	1.	Problem Definition
	2.	Data
	3.	Evaluation
	4.	Features
	5.	Modeliing
	6.	Experimentation
	
1. Problem Definition
Given some clinical parameters about patients, can we predict wheather or not they have heart diseases?

2. Data
The data came from the Cleaveland data from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/heart+disease

3. Evaluation
If we can reach 95% accuracy wheather a patient has heart disease during the proof of concept, we'll pursue the project.

4. Features
Data Dictionary
(age): age in years
(sex): sex (1 = male; 0 = female)
(cp): chest pain type
(trestbps): resting blood pressure (in mm Hg on admission to the hospital)
(chol): serum cholestoral in mg/dl
(fbs): (fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl) (1 = true; 0 = false)
(restecg): resting electrocardiographic results
(thalach): maximum heart rate achieved
(exang): exercise induced angina (1 = yes; 0 = no)
(oldpeak)= ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest
(slope): the slope of the peak exercise ST segment
(ca): number of major vessels (0-3) colored by flourosopy
(thal): 1 = normal; 2 = fixed defect; 3 = reversable defect
(target) (the predicted attribute)
